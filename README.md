## Publishing Your App Over The Internet Using Ngrok

Ngrok allows you to expose your locally running app to the internet with a public URL.

1. **Download and install ngrok:**  
   Visit [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the version for your system.

2. **Run your PDF Summariser app locally** (see above).

3. **Expose your local server (port 5000) using ngrok:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000 --host-header="localhost:5000"
   ```

4. **Copy the public URL** shown in your terminal (e.g., `https://abcdefg.ngrok.io`) and share it.  
   Anyone with this link will be able to access your PDF Summariser app over the internet.

**Note:** The ngrok tunnel will only be active while ngrok is running. Restart ngrok each time you restart your app, and you will get a new public URL.
